# Vercel Accessibility Rules
- **Redundant Status:** Never rely on color alone; always include text labels for status cues.
- **Icon Names:** Icon-only buttons must have a descriptive `aria-label`.
- **Focus States:** Ensure visible, high-contrast focus rings for keyboard navigation.
- **Tables:** Use `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` for comparing numbers.
