# Vercel Copywriting Standards
- **Active Voice:** Say "Install the CLI" instead of "The CLI will be installed."
- **Title Case:** Use Title Case (Chicago style) for headings and buttons.
- **Tone:** Be clear, concise, and default to positive, problem-solving language.
- **Formatting:** - Use numerals for counts ("8 deployments" vs "eight").
  - Use the ellipsis character (…) instead of three periods (...).
  - Use curly quotes (“ ”) instead of straight quotes (" ").

# Icon Standards
- **Material Symbols Only:** Use Material Symbols for UI icons.
- **Style:** Use the rounded set (`Material Symbols Rounded`).
- **Default Axes:** Use `opsz=20`, `wght=400`, `FILL=0`, `GRAD=0` unless a design explicitly requires otherwise.
- **Consistency:** Keep icon style/axes consistent across buttons, inputs, and navigation controls.

#Alpine.js project rules
- **Always use Alpine.js for DOM manipulation and reactivity. 
- **Favor 'x-data', 'x-init', and 'x-model' for state management.
- **When writing components, keep logic inline for simple cases, but suggest <script> based 'Alpine.data()' for complex components.
- **Do not suggest heavy frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular.
- **Ensure all event listeners use the '@' shorthand (e.g., @click instead of x-on:click).
- **Follow the official Alpine.js best practices for performance (e.g., using x-cloak to prevent flickering).
-** Don't use Tailwind or anything related with this project
