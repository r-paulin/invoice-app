# Vercel Copywriting Standards
- **Active Voice:** Say "Install the CLI" instead of "The CLI will be installed."
- **Title Case:** Use Title Case (Chicago style) for headings and buttons.
- **Tone:** Be clear, concise, and default to positive, problem-solving language.
- **Formatting:** - Use numerals for counts ("8 deployments" vs "eight").
  - Use the ellipsis character (…) instead of three periods (...).
  - Use curly quotes (“ ”) instead of straight quotes (" ").
